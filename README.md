# newsgen

**newsgen** is an open-source CLI framework for building your own news engine.  
Modular. Transparent. Yours.

---

Mainstream media is centralized.  
Feeds are noisy, fragmented, and filtered through someone else's agenda.

**newsgen** gives you the tools to control your own flow of information —  
from sources you choose, transformed how you want, delivered where it matters.

---

## Why?

Because we’re tired of reading someone else’s version of the truth.  
Because we don’t trust algorithmic feeds to decide what matters.  
Because we want to read more — but only what’s meaningful.

**newsgen** is not a feed. Not a service.  
It’s an infrastructure for your own personal newsroom.

---

## How it works

`newsgen` follows a simple, three-stage architecture:

1. **Input** — Parse raw data from any source: RSS, Telegram, APIs, files
2. **Transform** — Filter, verify, summarize, reformat, enrich with AI or rules
3. **Output** — Deliver final headlines via email, Telegram, webhooks, Markdown, etc.

Everything is modular, editable, and hackable.  
No black boxes. No hidden logic.  
You write the rules.
