# VISION — newsgen

## The Problem

Modern news is no longer a source of clarity.  
It is a stream — fast, overwhelming, repetitive.  
We do not read to understand, we scroll to endure.

Most platforms decide for us:  
what to see, when to see it, and how it should feel.  
The algorithms speak first.  
We respond later — often, too late.

Truth becomes a matter of formatting.  
Trust, a function of branding.  
And choice? A forgotten interface.

## What We Believe

We believe the right to information is not just about access.  
It’s about control.

Control over **source**.  
Control over **structure**.  
Control over **how news enters your world**.

We believe news should be:

- **Modular** — broken down, composable, and rewired
- **Transparent** — no hidden logic, no secret feeds
- **Customizable** — not just to your preferences, but to your principles

## What We’re Building

**newsgen** is a CLI framework — not a service, not a SaaS.

It’s a minimal, open, hackable engine that helps anyone build their own news system:

- pull information from any source
- transform it through custom logic
- deliver it where and how you want

This is not an aggregator.  
It’s infrastructure.

Not a feed.  
A pipeline.

## In Two Years…

We imagine a world where:

- developers build their own personal newsbots
- small editors automate delivery to readers without losing voice
- journalists use it to cross-check sources and streamline daily monitoring
- readers receive information in their native language, in a way they can trust

And in this world, the infrastructure is open, forkable, inspectable.  
Forever.

## Our Values

- **Freedom over convenience**
- **Structure over noise**
- **Understanding over engagement**
- **Process over brand**

---

## Not Just Open Source

This is not a project to gather stars.  
It’s a call to reimagine how we listen to the world.  
And how we refuse to be programmed by it.

We’re not here to compete with the feed.  
We’re here to build a different channel — one that serves us.

**newsgen** is yours to run, fork, and redefine.

No black box.  
No backend lock-in.  
No terms of service.  
Only text. Only code. Only intention.

## Stay tuned.

The noise is loud. But signal is coming.
